.SH NAME
.B "dynsim (DynamicSimulator)"
.RI "- is an open source project for helping with visualization and simulation of physical systems."
.SH SYNOPSIS
.RI "./program |"
.B dynsim
.RI [ options ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dynsim
.RI "is a program writen in C and use OpenGL and GLFW to create a window that shows the simulation, the data for the program are passed by the pipe '|' program, mostly present on linux systems. For now, are 5 modes of visualization, one-dimensional mode that shows a grid with color scale, one one-dimensional mode with particles, a two-dimensional mode of grid, and a two-dimensional mode of circles (particles), and for addition we are working on a mode of arrows, for systems like the Heisenberg model."
